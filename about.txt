Description:-
This project will take us through the process of mashing up data from two different APIs to make movie recommendations. The TasteDive API lets us provide a movie (or bands, TV shows, etc.)
 as a query input, and returns a set of related items. The OMDB API lets us provide a movie title as a query input and get back data about the movie, including scores from various review
 sites (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, etc.). We will put those two together. We will use TasteDive to get related movies for a whole list of titles. Weâ€™ll combine the resulting lists of related
 movies, and sort them according to their Rotten Tomatoes scores (which will require making API calls to the OMDB API.)
